For this resource to work, you must install the files to their relevant folders.
For the map file, first create a new map in your project, save the project, and
close RPG Maker XP. Once that's done, copy the resource's map file into your
project, delete the new map file, and rename the resource to the number of the
map you just deleted (Example: if the new map was 32, delete Map032.rxdata
and rename MapXXX.rxdata to Map032.rxdata). This should make it so the map with 
the Apricorn Trees is present in your project now.

Once all files are properly inserted, you should be able to use the Apricorn
Trees however you like.
